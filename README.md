### Acknowledgements

Without the work of [Romain FranÃ§ois](https://github.com/romainfrancois), `bibtex`
likely wouldn't exist. Romain was the principal developer of `bibtex` up until 
2020 when he was unable to continue supporting the package due to time 
commitments. His work will continue on thanks in part to his willingness to 
donate it to rOpenSci.
